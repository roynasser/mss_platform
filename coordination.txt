3. Session recording indicators and playback interface
4. Enhanced technician workspace with embedded tool mockups
5. Real-time connection status monitoring dashboard
6. Session management and audit trail visualization

CURRENT TASK: Building mock remote access interfaces for demonstration

DECISIONS MADE:
- Project: Cybersecurity MSS Platform from CYBERSECURITY_MSS_PLATFORM_SPEC.md
