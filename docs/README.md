## üéØ Platform Purpose

The MSS Platform serves cybersecurity Managed Security Services providers by:

- **Enabling Corporate Customers** to view security reports, request interventions, and manage their security posture
- **Empowering Internal Technicians** with secure remote access to customer environments without credential exposure
- **Maintaining Complete Audit Trails** for compliance with SOC2, ISO27001, and other security standards
- **Providing Multi-Tenant Architecture** supporting multiple customer organizations with role-based access

## üõ°Ô∏è Security First

This platform is designed with security as the primary concern:
- All remote access is proxied through secure gateways
- Technicians never have direct access to customer credentials
- Complete audit logging of all activities
- Regular automated security scanning and dependency updates
- Enterprise-grade authentication with MFA support
