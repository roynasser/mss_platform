# GitHub Strategy & Repository Management

## Repository Structure & Organization

### Monorepo Architecture Decision

**Chosen Approach:** Single repository with workspace-based organization

**Repository Structure:**
```
mss-platform/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/                  # Applications
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/          # Customer/Admin web interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/               # Backend API service
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ technician-app/    # Future: Specialized technician interface
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/              # Shared libraries
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/                # Shared UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/              # Authentication utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api-client/        # API client library
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/             # TypeScript definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ services/              # Microservices (future)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ remote-access/     # Remote access proxy
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ audit/             # Audit logging service
â””â”€â”€ infrastructure/        # Deployment & operations
    â”œâ”€â”€ docker/            # Container configurations
    â”œâ”€â”€ database/          # Database schemas & migrations
    â””â”€â”€ kubernetes/        # Kubernetes manifests
```

**Benefits of Monorepo:**
- **Atomic Deployments**: Related changes deployed together
- **Shared Code**: Easy sharing of types, components, utilities
- **Consistent Tooling**: Unified linting, testing, building
- **Simplified CI/CD**: Single pipeline for all services
- **Better Collaboration**: Easier code reviews across services

## Branch Strategy

### Git Flow Implementation

**Main Branches:**
- **`main`**: Production-ready code, protected with strict rules
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features, auto-deployed to staging

**Supporting Branches:**
- **`feature/*`**: Individual features (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)
- **`hotfix/*`**: Emergency production fixes (e.g., `hotfix/security-patch`)
- **`release/*`**: Release preparation (e.g., `release/v1.2.0`)

### Branch Protection Rules

**Main Branch Protection:**
```yaml
main:
  required_reviews: 2
  required_reviewers: [platform-admins, security-team]
  dismiss_stale_reviews: true
  require_code_owner_reviews: true
  required_status_checks:
    - "CI Pipeline"
    - "Security Scan"
    - "Type Check"
  restrict_pushes: true
  allow_force_pushes: false
  allow_deletions: false
```

**Develop Branch Protection:**
```yaml
develop:
  required_reviews: 1
  required_status_checks:
    - "CI Pipeline"
    - "Security Scan"
  allow_force_pushes: false
```

3. **Documentation**: Release notes and migration guides
4. **Security Review**: Final security assessment
5. **Production Deployment**: Staged rollout with monitoring
6. **Post-Release**: Monitoring and hotfix readiness

### Automated Release Pipeline

**Release Workflow:**
