## Security Considerations

### Access Controls
- **Role-based Authentication**: Only authorized technician/admin access
- **Customer Isolation**: Technicians can only access assigned customers
- **Credential Validation**: All stored credentials verified before use
- **Session Encryption**: All traffic encrypted end-to-end

### Audit Requirements
- **Complete Logging**: All remote access sessions fully logged
- **User Attribution**: Every action tied to specific user identity
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: All logs include precise timestamps
- **Compliance Ready**: Logging format suitable for compliance reporting

### Best Practices
1. **Use Appropriate Credentials**: Select minimum privilege level needed
2. **Document Actions**: Use session notes for complex operations
3. **Verify Changes**: Always confirm configuration changes
4. **Clean Disconnect**: Use `exit` command to properly terminate sessions
5. **Regular Credential Rotation**: Ensure credentials are updated regularly
