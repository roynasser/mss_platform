# Phase 3: Multi-Tenant Management Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of Phase 3 of the Cybersecurity MSS Platform, focusing on multi-tenant customer management backend APIs. This phase builds upon the existing authentication system and provides a comprehensive multi-tenant management foundation.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Multi-Tenant Service** - Central service for organization and technician access management
2. **Audit Service** - Comprehensive audit logging and compliance reporting
3. **Multi-Tenant Middleware** - Authorization and access control enforcement
4. **API Routes** - RESTful endpoints for all multi-tenant operations

## Database Schema Alignment

The implementation uses the existing database schema from `cybersecurity_mss_schema.sql` with the following key tables:

- `organizations` - Customer companies and MSS provider
- `users` - User accounts with role-based access control
- `technician_customer_access` - Individual technician-to-customer access assignments
- `audit_logs` - Comprehensive audit trail
- `user_sessions` - JWT session management

```typescript
interface APIResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  message?: string;
  details?: any;
}
```

### Pagination Support
```typescript
interface PaginatedResponse<T> extends APIResponse<T> {
  data: {
    items: T[];
    total: number;
    page: number;
    limit: number;
    totalPages: number;
  };
}
```
